### Future

I am not a professional game developer (this is my first game), and I do not know if it makes sense to develop it, but if there is activity on the repository, then I'm going to do:

1. Music and sprites update 
2. Add more obstacles

[and many other things...](https://github.com/YariKartoshe4ka/Space-Way/blob/master/docs/TODO.md)
